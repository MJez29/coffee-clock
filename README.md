# CoffeeClock

### By Michal Jez, Eddie Ren and James Long

CoffeeClock is is the ultimate solution to the coffee aficionado who simply wakes up too late to grab a coffee on their way to class.

It features an Android and an iOS app which are essentially alarm clock apps that, when the alarm goes off, communicate with a Raspberry Pi connected to a Keurig machine to begin brewing a cup of coffee.
